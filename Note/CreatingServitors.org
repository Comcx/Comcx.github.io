Motivational syndromes (desire) are fundamental to Spare's form of magick, 
hence the name of his most popular book, "The Book of Pleasure." 
Spare and magicians, Chaos or otherwise, 
have adopted the Jungian expansion of Freud's theory of the Unconscious. 
Jung theorized the existence of a collective unconscious, shared by all. 
He considered it to be transpersonal and the residue of the evolution of humankind.
