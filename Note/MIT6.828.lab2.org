#+Title:  MIT6.828 Lab 2
#+Author: Comcx


#+SETUPFILE: theme-readtheorg-local.setup

Let's make abstractions of memory space!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Lab 2 contains the following new source files, which you should browse through:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
inc/memlayout.h
kern/pmap.c
kern/pmap.h
kern/kclock.h
kern/kclock.c
#+END_SRC

=memlayout.h= describes the layout of the virtual address space that you must implement by modifying pmap.c. 
=memlayout.h= and =pmap.h= define the PageInfo structure that you'll use to keep track of which pages of physical memory are free. 
=kclock.c= and =kclock.h= manipulate the PC's battery-backed clock and CMOS RAM hardware, 
in which the BIOS records the amount of physical memory the PC contains, among other things. 
The code in pmap.c needs to read this device hardware in order to figure out how much physical memory there is, 
but that part of the code is done for you: you do not need to know the details of how the CMOS hardware works.

Pay particular attention to =memlayout.h= and =pmap.h=, since this lab requires you to use and understand many of the definitions they contain. 
You may want to review =inc/mmu.h=, too, as it also contains a number of definitions that will be useful for this lab.

** Part 1: Physical Page Management
*** Exercise 1
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the file kern/pmap.c, you must implement code for the following functions (probably in the order given).

#+BEGIN_SRC 
boot_alloc()
mem_init() (only up to the call to check_page_free_list(1))
page_init()
page_alloc()
page_free()
#+END_SRC

=check_page_free_list()= and =check_page_alloc()= test your physical page allocator. 
You should boot JOS and see whether =check_page_alloc()= reports success. 
Fix your code so that it passes. You may find it helpful to add your own assert()s to verify that your assumptions are correct.
#+END_QUOTE
Before writing codes, I need to read and understand =kern/pmap.h= and =inc/memlayout.h= first.

**** =inc/memlayout.h= 
Here we have the entire virtual memory map which we need to implement later.

** Part 2: Virtual Memory

Look at chapters 5 and 6 of the Intel 80386 Reference Manual, if you haven't done so already. 
Read the sections about page translation and page-based protection closely (5.2 and 6.4). 
We recommend that you also skim the sections about segmentation; 
while JOS uses the paging hardware for virtual memory and protection, 
segment translation and segment-based protection cannot be disabled on the x86, so you will need a basic understanding of it.

While GDB can only access QEMU's memory by virtual address, 
it's often useful to be able to inspect physical memory while setting up virtual memory. 
Review the QEMU monitor commands from the lab tools guide, especially the xp command, 
which lets you inspect physical memory. 
To access the QEMU monitor, press =Ctrl-a c= in the terminal (the same binding returns to the serial console).

Use the =xp= command in the QEMU monitor and the x command in GDB to inspect memory at 
corresponding physical and virtual addresses and make sure you see the same data.

Our patched version of QEMU provides an =info pg= command that may also prove useful: 
it shows a compact but detailed representation of the current page tables, including all mapped memory ranges, permissions, and flags. 
Stock QEMU also provides an info mem command that shows an overview of which ranges of virtual addresses are mapped and with what permissions.
#+END_QUOTE

QEMU's monitor command:
- =xp/Nx paddr= 
  
  Display a hex dump of N words starting at physical address paddr. 
  If N is omitted, it defaults to 1. This is the physical memory analogue of GDB's x command.

- =info registers= 

  Display a full dump of the machine's internal register state. 
  In particular, this includes the machine's hidden segment state for the segment selectors and the local, global, and 
  interrupt descriptor tables, plus the task register. 
  This hidden state is the information the virtual CPU read from the GDT/LDT when the segment selector was loaded.

To help document the code, in JOS, type =uintptr_t= and =physaddr_t= are just synonyms for =uint32_t= .

**** Question
- Solution: type is uintptr_t since it's used as virtual addr.

In the file kern/pmap.c, you must implement code for the following functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
        pgdir_walk()
        boot_map_region()
        page_lookup()
        page_remove()
        page_insert()
#+END_SRC

=check_page()=, called from =mem_init()=, tests your page table management routines. You should make sure it reports success before proceeding.
