#+Title: About me

I'm *Comcx*

This is a very simple and light-weight personal blog.
I am just trying to make things simple and stupid.

This blog may mainly contain articles on _Math_, _Functional Programming_, _Linguistics_ and _Animations_.
I'm just a person who's trying to get better understanding of the world and
to get better programming skills. My goal is to *create a programming language* which can
satisfy me while programming.

I tried to program with /C++,/ /Scala,/ /Haskell,/ /Racket/ and many other interesting programming languages.
They all in a sense makes me get better understanding of programming(especially Scala and Haskell).

The life is short and I may not be smart enough to achieve my goal, but I really love all these things.
The articles and ideas may looks stupid, but I think they will become valuable some day in the future.




The last thing, if you want to find me, go to this page of /comcx.fun,/ and read me again.
